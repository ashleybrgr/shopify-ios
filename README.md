# Task
You're a successful Shopify merchant! You sell all sorts of nifty things and you’re curious about how your new Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards are selling! Create a mobile app that calculates and displays the following data:
The total order revenue for all products
The number of Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards that have sold

You can access your orders with this link:
https://shopicruit.myshopify.com/admin/orders.json?page=1&access_token=c32313df0d0ef512ca64d5b336a0d7c6

Note that the link is only for the first page of orders (for this problem you can ignore any additional pages). If you’re using Android, here are a couple simple libraries that you can use to fetch the data (these are optional, you can pick one or use any other alternative):
https://developer.android.com/training/volley/index.html
http://square.github.io/okhttp/

A description of the data for each order is available in the Shopify API documentation here:
https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/order

What to submit:
1. The total order revenue (for all products) and number of Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards as plain text
2. A screenshot of your app showing, in a simple view, the total order revenue and number of Aerodynamic Cotton Keyboards sold
3. Your project code
